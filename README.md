# Movie app

This project is supposed to be a starter kit (if i may call it that :) ) for rapid prototyping. It is not production ready!

It consists of two components:
 * Springboot backend app with:
    * H2 and Liquibase
    * JWT authentication
    * Swagger
 * Angular frontend app with:
    * Login page with jwt authentication
    * Movie listing page
    
Feel free to use it. Check each project to know more about it and how to use it.

Kudos to all the developers of the internet and stackoverflow community. Without you i'd be out of a job :).
