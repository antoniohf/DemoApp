This is intended to be a kotlin springboot starter project with:
  * springboot base structure in kotlin
  * Liquibase db migration
  * JWT authentication

Feel free to use this for rapid prototyping, along with the angular project (frontend)

# Development server

Run ```gradlew bootrun``` to start springboot. Upon start, springboot will create a h2 database and run liquibase migrations on it.
